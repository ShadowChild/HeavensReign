# HeavensReign [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ShadowChild/HeavensReign.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ShadowChild/HeavensReign)

## Building from source

To build HeavensReign from source you *must* clone this repo, and initialise the submodules.

You can initialise the submodules by either using a git client, or by using the command `git submodule init`.

Once the submodules are initialised, you can run either either of the `Setup` scripts and this will then resolve and compile the dependencies.

After this step has completed, you can then import the project from the `pom.xml`.

You can then run the game from the `io.github.shadowchild.heavensreign.HeavensReign` class.
